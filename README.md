# flappy-bird-neat
a project in 2020 July about implementing a flappy bird AI using the neat module (genetic algorithm) in Python\
it is based on Tech with Tim's tutorial on Youtube.\
the project gave me a grasp of how genetic algorithms work, as well as basics in implementing a Python game (e.g. use of class/physics behind)
